# @vue/observer

> This package is inlined into UMD & Browser ESM builds of user-facing renderers (e.g. `@vue/runtime-dom`), but also published as a package that can be used standalone. The standalone build should not be used alongside a pre-bundled build of a user-facing renderer, as they will have different internal storage for reactivity connections. A user-facing renderer should re-export all APIs from this package.
