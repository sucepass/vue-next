// - Parse expressions in templates into more detailed JavaScript ASTs so that
//   source-maps are more accurate
//
// - Prefix identifiers with `_ctx.` so that they are accessed from the render
//   context
//
// - This transform is only applied in non-browser builds because it relies on
//   an additional JavaScript parser. In the browser, there is no source-map
//   support and the code is wrapped in `with (this) { ... }`.
